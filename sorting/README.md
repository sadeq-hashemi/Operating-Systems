Sorting Records by Column: 

"You will write a simple sorting program. 

This program should be invoked as follows:

shell% ./varsort -i inputfile -o outputfile [-c column]
The above line means the users typed in the name of the sorting program ./varsort with three arguments:

- an input file to sort called inputfile
- an output file called outputfile to put the sorted results
- a column number called column that we will sort the records based on the data from this column (note that column number starts from 0 as most computer scientists do). This is an optional argument and hence in a bracket. If this optional argument is not provided, then output should be sorted based on column 0.
